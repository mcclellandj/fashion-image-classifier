## Classifying items of fashion into categories

A deep learning convnet model which classifies images of fashion items into 10 categories

### Project objectives

- Build a deep learning convnet model which classifies images of fashion items into 10 categories (ankle boot, bag, coat, dress, pullover, sandal, shirt, sneaker, t-shirt/top and trouser) using the keras Fashion MNIST dataset
- Use a best practice process of building a model which minimises under- and over-fitting and has an architecture which is neither under- or over-capacity 
- The model should have significant power in terms of beating the accuracy performance of the following baseline models:
    - random classifier - 10% (as the data is balanced)
    - basic fully connected dense neural network
