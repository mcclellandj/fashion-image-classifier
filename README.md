## Classifying items of fashion into categories

### Project objectives

- Build a deep learning convnet model which classifies images of fashion items into categories using the keras Fashion MNIST dataset which comprises the following 10 categories:
    - Ankle boots
    - Bags
    - Coats
    - Dresses
    - Pullovers
    - Sandals
    - Shirts
    - Sneakers
    - T-shirts/tops
    - Trousers
- Use a best practice process of building a model which minimises under- and over-fitting and has an architecture which is neither under- or over-capacity 
- The model should have significant power in terms of beating the accuracy performance of the following baseline models:
    - random classifier - 10% (as the data is balanced)
    - basic fully connected dense neural network\

and be comparable to results of published models
