## Classifying items of fashion into categories

### Project objectives

- Build a deep learning convnet model from scratch which classifies images of fashion items into categories using the keras Fashion MNIST dataset which comprises the following 10 categories:
        1. Ankle boots
        2. Bags
        3. Coats
        4. Dresses
        5. Pullovers
        6. Sandals
        7. Shirts
        8. Sneakers
        9. T-shirts/tops
        10. Trousers
- Use a best practice process of building a model which minimises under- and over-fitting and has an architecture which is neither under- or over-capacity 
- The model should have significant power in terms of beating the accuracy performance of the following baseline models:
    - random classifier - 10% (as the data is balanced)
    - basic fully connected dense neural network

  and be comparable to results of published models

- Compare the model's performance with that of a model built using the pretrained VGG16 convnet
